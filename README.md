## 📖 Project Overview

This is a **beginner-friendly IPL data analysis project** built using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn on Google Colab.  
It explores real IPL batting statistics to identify top performers based on:

- 🥇 Total Runs
- 🚀 Strike Rate (min 100 balls faced)
- 🎯 Batting Average (min 10 dismissals)

Each metric is visualized using **colorful, clean bar charts** powered by Seaborn.

## 📊 Features

- ✅ Load and clean IPL player batting data
- 🔍 Filter players based on meaningful thresholds
- 📈 Visualize top 10 performers for runs, SR, and averages
- 💡 Focus on clarity and presentation for beginner analysts

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- 🐍 Python
- 🧹 Pandas
- 🎨 Seaborn
- 📊 Matplotlib
- ☁️ Google Colab
